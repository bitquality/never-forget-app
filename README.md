# Never Forget

Never Forget is a spaced repetition learning app designed to be as simple as possible to use! It will feature a flash-card based learning interface, as this is a rather familiar method of learning for folks. So far, a [CLI version](https://github.com/tmns/never-forget-cli) and the [backend server](https://github.com/tmns/never-forget-server) have been fully implemented - so feel free to play around with both while I work on tying everything together here.

For now, this repo can be considered under heavy construction!
